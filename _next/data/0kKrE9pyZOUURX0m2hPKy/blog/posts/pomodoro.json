{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"pomodoro","contentHtml":"<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique\">pomodoro technique</a> is a time management technique\nthat can be helpful to break down tasks into smaller more accomplishable goals and subtasks.\nThe technique uses 4 work intervals (of about 25 minutes in length for each) and 3 short breaks followed by a longer\nbreak at the end of the 4 pomodoro work intervals.</p>\n<p>This technique can prove helpful for studying and completing work over the course of these smaller segments.\nI recently wrote up a lightweight program called <a href=\"https://github.com/jmdaemon/pomodoro\"><code>pomodoro</code></a> that\ncan help you keep track of your pomodoro time intervals.</p>\n<p>The four work periods are adjustable through a custom config file (which is determined by the environment\nvariable <code>POMODORO_CONFIG</code>). It even supports a 'pause' feature which occurs after your break so you can take\nmore time to have a breather or just keep your pomodoro status tracked until after a meeting.\nThere's a progress bar and it also shows you the current time and how far you're in for\nyour current pomodoro interval.</p>\n<p>I hope this program proves as useful to you as it does for me.</p>\n","title":"Pomodoro: Start Smaller and Study Smarter","date":"2022-03-28"}},"__N_SSG":true}
